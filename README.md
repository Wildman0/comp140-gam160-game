# Game Concept

The game will be 3D and consist of a top down view on 2 trash compactors with a conveyor belt moving a number of different items 
towards the compactor. Some of these will be items which the player wants to compact, such as an aluminium can or other various sorts 
of trash. Other items will be ones they want to avoid crushing such as a bomb or a baby. Crushing the trash will increase the player's 
score by 500 for a direct hit, 300 for a slightly off time hit and 100 for a way off time hit, as well as increasing their score 
multiplier by 1x (Look at a game called Osu! for the same scoring system, albeit in a very different game). Trying to crush something 
the player shouldn't or not crushing something they should will make them lose lives and reset their score modifier. 
As the game goes on, the conveyor belts will speed up, increasing the challenge for the player. This can either go on until the player 
can't keep up anymore or it can be a timed game.

#Custom Controller Concept

For this game, I will be creating 2 hammers with pressure sensors in them, labelled as the left and right hammer. 
Instead of just pushing some buttons to activate the compactors, the player will hit these hammers against something, 
activating the pressure sensor in the end of them.
